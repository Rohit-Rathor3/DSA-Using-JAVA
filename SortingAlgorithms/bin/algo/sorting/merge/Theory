Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that works by dividing an array into smaller subarrays, sorting each subarray, 
and then merging the sorted subarrays back together to form the final sorted array.

Time Complexity: O(N log(N))
Auxiliary Space: O(n)


keypoints:- First, we will divide the array into individual parts, then we will sort and merge each subarray.
