Bubble Sort:-  is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. 
               This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.
               
Use :- To sort an array.

Time Complexity: O(N2)
Auxiliary Space: O(1) 

key points:- We will fixed the largest/smallest element in its required position in every isteration. Not recommeended in large data sets.
