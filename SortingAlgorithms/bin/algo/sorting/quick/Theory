In quicksort , it is required to get pivot element index through partition method.
-- Here , i am letting last element as the pivot element.
-- All the smaller elements to pivot elemet will be inserted or swapped in left side( before the pivot element).
-- after that pivot element will be swapped becoz this will be its correct position to be inserted.
-- same steps we will repeat using recursive calls of quickSort() method.
-- first for low to pivot_element_index-1.
-- Second for pivot_element_index to high.

Worst case TC - > O(n2).
