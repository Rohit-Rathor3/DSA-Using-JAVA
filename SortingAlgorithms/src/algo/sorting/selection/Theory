Selection sort :- is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the 
                  unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list.
                  
Use:- To sort.

Time Complexity: The time complexity of Selection Sort is O(N2) as there are two nested loops:

One loop to select an element of Array one by one = O(N)
Another loop to compare that element with every other Array element = O(N)
Therefore overall complexity = O(N) * O(N) = O(N*N) = O(N2)

Auxiliary Space: O(1) as the only extra memory used is for temporary variables while swapping two values in Array. 
The selection sort never makes more than O(N) swaps and can be useful when the memory write is a costly operation.  

KeyPoints :- This is much better than Bubble sort becoz here swapping take place one per interation.
